# Privacy Statement

Hero Education is committed to protecting the privacy and
accuracy of confidential information to the extent possible, subject to provisions of
state and federal law.

## Concerned about privacy? We are too.

Although there are many applications and websites that collect information and
other statistics about their users, our messenger bot DOES NOT collect any personal information about you.
Having messaged a trigger keyword, namely _HSCTrialPapers_ and that alone, the messenger bot will send
a single link back to a Google Drive folder. At no point do we access any personal information about you as provided
by your Facebook account.

## What about privacy on other web sites?

This messenger bot is only authorised to send a single link to a Google Drive folder.
This website is owned by a third party. We provide this link for your convenience, but we do
not review, control, or monitor the privacy practices of websites of third parties operated by
others.

We are not responsible for the performance of web sites operated by third parties
or for your business dealings with them. Therefore, whenever you leave dialogue with our page, via the link to the Google Drive folder, we recommend that you review the web site's privacy practices and make
your own conclusions regarding the adequacy of these practices.

## What happens if the privacy statement changes?

This Privacy Statement was last revised on the 26th of July 2018. We may change this Privacy
Statement at any time and for any reason. We encourage you to review this Privacy
Statement before you interact with our messenger bot under the Hero Education page.
If we decide to make a significant change to our Privacy Statement, we will post a
notice on the homepage of our web site and our Facebook page for a period of time after the change is made.
